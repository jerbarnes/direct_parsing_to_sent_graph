# Smatch (semantic match) tool

This is source code of [smatch](http://amr.isi.edu/evaluation.html), an evaluation tool for AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation). 

The code here is based on [Shu Cai](https://github.com/snowblink14)'s [smatch v1.0.2](https://github.com/danielhers/smatch/tree/1.0.2), with some changes to allow programmatic usage.

More details and updates about AMR and smatch can be found in USC/ISI's AMR site: http://amr.isi.edu/index.html
